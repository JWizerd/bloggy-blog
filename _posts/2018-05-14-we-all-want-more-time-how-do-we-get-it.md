Most of our days are spent in an area that looks similar to the image above. This is where we really live. I'm positive that most of us don't really want to be here but because we are highly adaptive creatures we learn to muster up the motivation to trudge on through another day of fake smiles, empty conversations, and enough caffeine to kill your cat. 

I'll quote Seneca here.

> “It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much. ... The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully.” 
― Seneca, On the Shortness of Life 

See, the truth is, we all have the same 24 hours in a day. Yet, somehow some people seem to live so much longer than others each day. How is it that the millionaire writer can achieve so much in the same 24 hours as you can? You already know the answer. **Priorities. **

### If you want more time you have to let go of the things you don't want to do.

Now I know that sounds extremely narcissistic but I'm not referring to taking time to help your wife with taxes or making time to exercise. I'm referring to the events in your day that serve no purpose and can be thought of as **real-life spam** flooding your day; cornering you into meaningless obligations. **These have Gotta. Fucking. Go.**

Just to be clear, I lack mastery of this myself. I assure you, this post is not only directed to you but it's also directed to me. For instance, today alone, mowing the grass, fixing yet another thing on my vehicle, obligated to "chaperone"  a code meet up after work (which turned out fun and I'm glad I took the time for daily societal contribution). With only four hours of free time after 10hrs of work (including commute time) when things stack up like this in my life externally I do them with smile while other people are watching because I'm an adult but internally, whoah buddeh!

While responsibilities need to be taken care of we do only have 24 hours in the day and all of these kept me away from doing the two things that after work I enjoy doing because I know they make me a better person; writing and programming. I think it's fair to say that If obligations are getting in the way of you having meangful relationships, helping me keep a healthy lifestyle, are keeping from having spiritual time with God, or are preventing you from developing and monetizing your passion; then you need to minimalize your lifestyle.

So, let me take a guess, since you already are looking for more time or else you wouldn't have found this post. There are a lot of things that are getting in your way of living long and fullfilling days. Your days are probably structured with; maintaining relationships that are only present as the direct result of you just being in the same location as other people, rather than truly pursuing meaningful relationships, taking part in negative activities that are only taking up your time because you were too afraid of what people were going to think of you if said No. And, you're probably working a shitty job and could be in a lot better shape because of the two previous symptoms and because you've lost passion in your life. 

## So, let's refactor.

Right now I'm going to make a pledge and I'd love for you guys to take it with me. That'll you take the hard moves. You'll take the time this week to analyze your life find the daily / weekly activities that are only adding weight and make you feel stuck. Start shedding that weight by removing something each week and then write about. **Journal about this process like you have your time back.** 

This is only the beginning and with each item you shed, stop, and notice how that face that you see in the mirror every day starts to look more and more like you again.
