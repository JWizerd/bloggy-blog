### **â€“ Lao Tzu**

Ok, so maybe Lao Tzu didn't say it just like that but like any programmer I take things that already exist and modify them to my needs. When I first began coding two years ago, I had a really hard time embracing that; being ok with using existing code. I thought that if I didn't create everything from scratch then I didn't deserve to use a library like [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) or[ Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) *(For some reason I was ok with using jQuery though?)*.
