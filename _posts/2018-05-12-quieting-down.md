# I never took the time to find myself.
I feel like lots of boys find their manhood by placing themselves in a situation, at least once in their lives, where all they have is themselves to rely on and what they find in return are the values that are held dearest to them; untainted by the thoughts of others. Unfortunately, I've never been good at not caring about what other people think. I was driven into college by a need to make my parents happy. I didn't love the love of my life for a long time when we first started dating and I feel that the reason I started dating her was less because I had feelings for her and more of that she was ecstatic to be with me and I couldn't let her down. The list can keep going on but I feel as if listing anything further I'd just sound ungrateful.

So lately, and this is the primary reason for writing this piece, I've noticed that people are picking up on identity crisis I'm having. My best friend last night told me "I've noticed for a while now how out of place you feel and how unhappy that makes you, It's really sad". I have other good friends who when we'd go out would always drink me under the table but now I see them settling down and I've realized that I'm the one who drinks the most now.

There is just this deep underlying existential itch that I still feel lives in me. I feel like Bilbo in the Hobbit whose knowledge is large but his experiences are few but deep down he feels the calling; the adventure awaits. I don't think a book or a class or  "running around the same old town" is going to quench this thirst.

I've hit a doorway and the universe is in inviting me in. Whatever it provides is up to the creator. All I need to do is just take a step and immediately feel **better**.
