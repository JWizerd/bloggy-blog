> “The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.” - Rober Swan, Author

I find myself believing all the time that my actions won't make a difference in this world. That only the greatest minds in the world will create the solutions that will change the current state the world is in. But soon after I slap myself across the face and I remind myself how absurd this notion is because when it comes down it, it was all of humanity who has put us into this environmental catastrophe; this increasing rate of depression and suicide; and this ever present disatisfaction and lust for all the of the wrong things and hesitation from all of the things worth savoring. 

If we are going to change, as cliche as it is, we have to create it and creating this lifestyle is theoretically simpler than the way you are probably living your life right now. After much contemplation and experimentation in my own life I've create a simple blueprint for how the average person can not only fix our environmental crisis but can create a life of unending satisfaction.

This post is a long one so I've broken it down into sections. The sections are as follows: 

#### 1. Master frugality
#### 2. Adopt a child instead
#### 3. Choose medi-share not health care
#### 4. Choose an eco-friendly career
#### 5. Minimalism
#### 6. Take control of your mind
#### 7. Start a movement!

**Let's begin!**

## 1. Master Frugality
**The most sustainable thing you can do is to stop consuming**. Period. I could end this topic on that and I feel like that statement would suffice but, I should probably to elaborat. Praciticing frugality and adapting it to all facets of your finances can be extremely liberating. Take my family for instance, my wife and I have calculated down to the cent about how much we spend on food as a whole per person (the amount is a misnomer but it's approx. $3.50 per person). This may be extreme but since my wife and I tend to have a pretty consistent diet during the week we can tweak our diet slightly in favor of cost effective nutrition and save a ton of money. 

Another thing about frugality to point out is that when you decide to cut down your expenses as low as possible you and know where every cent that you spend is going you can cut down so much that you exchange money for time. For instance, my wife and I have plans within the next 12 months to pay off my student loan debt, purchase an RV and become full-time travelers for a few years. In order to make sure we can afford all of this we have cut down our expenses drastically so that we are putting away at least 50% of our paychecks into our savings, debt and travel fund. The most exciting part about this is that we are savings so much money right that we are greatly surpassing the amount we need to put away each month to achieve our financial goals meaning, we can cash in some that workload for **more time**.  

When you decide to live a frugal lifestyle and you become very good at managing your finances you might just find that the full time job that you thought you needed to pay your bills and prepare for the future is something you can get rid of all together. You can instead; start your own personal business, work part-time, turn your passions into sources of income etc. No longer a slave to the machine (far out).

## 2. Adopt a child instead

I know I'm going to get a lot of heat for this but this article isn't meant to be comforting; it's meant to be a solution. Here it is: **We will solve most of the world's environmental issues if we find a solutuon to over-population**. I know that the bible says "be fruitful and multiply" I was there for that church sermon too. And, I know that there is this biological need to spread our genes and continue the cycle of evolution but there are a few things we are forgetting here. Luckily, we have a plethora of data to illuminate the negative effects!

> Theoretically, scientists believe **10 billion people** is the uppermost population limit that the current food sources on the planet can sustain and we will reach that number approximately by year 2050 as stated by Natalie Wolchover, B.S. in physics and author at LiveScience.com. 

To elaborate, the statistic above implies that if we stop expansion right now we can sustain 10 billion people in 2050. But, that is with the current amount of agricultural real estate on the planet **now** and inevitably if we increase our population by 150% we will need more food, housing, school, hospitals, waste managment etc. unless we change how current cities are engineered it is impossible that we will have enough surface area on the planet to feed 10 billion people without severly effecting the ecosystem. 

In addition to the issue of resources with over-population, there is an increasing number of children who are homeless, improverished or living in orphanges.

> **There are roughly 400,000 children in the US foster care system**. Of that number, approximately 100,000 are waiting to be adopted. - Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS)

So while, you're deciding on names of your future children, there are children who will never know what it is like to have parents they can depend on. 

## 3. Choose Medi-Share not Health Care

## 4. Choose an eco-friendly career

## 5. Minimalism

## 6. Take control of your mind

## 7. Start a movement!
