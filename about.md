**My name is Jeremiah**. I'm a software engineer by day, husband/blogger/wannabe philosopher by night. 

You may be wondering, why the name "**Simple Stoic**"? 

A Stoic is someone who practices Stoicism. Stoicism is an ancient philosophy originating in Greece and it's primarily concerned with teaching people how to live within your means, analyzing what those means are, and improving yourself by choosing to live a life of complete intention and purpose. 

If you'd like a more in depth definition of Stoicism [check out this article ](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/stoicism-101/)

After studying stoicism for some time and adopting the teachings into my own life I noticed that the people around me had no idea about this philosphy. **Enter the blog**. 

In a time where have the highest standard of living and yet the highest rate of depression and suicide stoicism provides an unbiased means to improve your life by simplifying the way you are living right now. 

Imagine for a moment if you got rid of all the expensive unnecessary possessions that you own so you could mitigate or completely pay off your debt, cancel all of the unnecessary appointments you have during your week and made room in your life for only the people that matter; yourself included. 

Stoicism provides a strategy of minification on a holistic scale and it's completely free.

Now, my plan with this blog is not to bore you with history lessons about stoicism because I think we should more concerned with the present than the past. My goal in this blog is to write about my life and how stoicism, minimalism and contemplation helps me become the best version of myself. 

### TLDR;

This blog is about my findings in stoicism and how it's simple teaching will help me to Live more, Work smarter, and LOVE a lot.
